# ASD Genetic Variant Analysis Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and data analysis for a study exploring the relationship between genetic variants and the presence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Utilizing Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) data from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge (SPARK) cohort, we employed various machine learning models to predict ASD. The study achieved notable performance, with the Logistic Regression classifier standing out, and provided insights into the genetic underpinnings of ASD through Explainable AI techniques.
